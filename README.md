# Better Economy

The goal of the mod is to fix bugs in the original game while minimizing deviation from the original gameplay mechanics.
This mod doesn’t make the game harder or easier; it makes your actions more meaningful.

For example, with the mod, if you set low commercial taxes, your companies will prosper and bring you significant profits in the distant future. Alternatively, you can raise taxes to gain money immediately, but this risks company collapses in the future. (In contrast, due to bugs in the original game, companies can collapse randomly.)

Ultimately, it’s not just a mod but a patch with many changes that should have been part of the game. (And I hope they will be in the future.)

Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where companies would randomly leave the city.
- Companies now rely solely on their funds to level up buildings (previously, they could level up even if heavily in debt).
- Fixed building upkeep charges so they subtract money from the renter instead of adding it.
- Fixed tax calculations for processing companies.
- Fixed garbage fees, which were previously collected at 16x the intended amount.
- Fixed amount of service subtracted from leisure companies.
- Fixed a bug where resource export companies were paid twice.

This mod alters the behavior of many systems, so any other mods that affect the economy, even slightly, are incompatible with it.

Known mods compatibility:
- Plop the Growables overrides some fixes; additionally, the building level lock doesn't work.

The mod works with old cities, but there’s a high chance that your city is already economically broken due to bugs. The city’s economy will stabilize, but it may take several hours of real time at 3x speed.
